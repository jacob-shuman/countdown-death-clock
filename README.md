## What is this?
- This is a reconstruction of the death clock from the 2019 movie [Countdown](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10039344/).
- The timer is completly randomized on every refresh and is never tracked.
- The site can be installed to your device as a [Progressive Web App](https://web.dev/what-are-pwas/)
- There are no ads on the site(nor will there ever be).
- Although this project is not actively contributed to it is not an exact replica of the movie version and pull requests/issues are more than welcome.
